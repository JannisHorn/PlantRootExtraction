#        -Relative radius

#        -Unsupported but extracted volume
# Smooth radius -> Calculate radius gradient
# Repair wrong root ids -> look for better radius fit -> look for better direction fit
# Use extracted volume as guide -> direction per segment -> look for better connectivity
# Reduce 3rd+ order branches -> rebuild branching areas -> combine branching areas in close proximity
